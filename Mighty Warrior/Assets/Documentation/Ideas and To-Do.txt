- Improve rigidbody physics (look at references .txt doc)
- Build boat in probuilder first as quick prototype, then make it in blender before polishing
- You see a disposable camera that has a few pictures already taken (you find out pictures are memories, or you find out pictures are more sinister?)
- You also find a journal with notes
- Everything in the game at the beginning with the dead body is actually all in your head (physical representation of repressed thoughts and my state of mind)
	* Game is about following brother, finding his dead body, wanting revenge and trying to find "killers", general anger then becomes understanding,
	bitterness and resentment, and then finally acceptance. This is when I am saved, when I accept that God was good for Jacob, and therefore would be
	good for me.
